# Open Gaming Collective

## Mission

Open Gaming Collective (OGC) provides an informal working group for organizations and individuals interested in improving the open source gaming ecosystem. The mission is to provide a collaborative framework for upstream changes to the various gaming components that will benefit all projects.

## Scope

OGC focuses on the foundational layers of the Linux gaming stack. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Graphics & Display: Mesa, Vulkan extensions, and windowing protocols (Wayland).
- Hardware Enablement: Kernel drivers, firmware coordination, and peripheral support (HID).

This working group will own an organization that will host shared components, agreed upon by the owners, that all can use.

## Owners Agreement

### Upstream First

"Upstream First" is a rigorous technical policy. It means that any code produced or improved by OGC is intended to live in the original source project (e.g., the official Mesa repository) rather than being maintained as a permanent "patch" or "fork" within OGC.
- Reducing Technical Debt: Owners agree not to "hoard" features. Carrying local patches makes software harder to update over time. By pushing for changes to exist upstream, owners ensure the long-term health of the gaming stack.
- Strategic Advocacy: With the "Owner" role definition, this involves Upstream Advocacy. Owners are agreeing to do the hard work of negotiating with upstream maintainers to get OGC’s improvements accepted into the main codebases.
- Sustainability: This commitment ensures that if OGC were to ever dissolve, the work wouldn't disappear; it would already be part of the foundational Linux ecosystem (Fedora, Arch, KDE, etc.).

### Document Upstream Work

The OGC has a commitment to ecosystem awareness and transparency. It ensures that OGC does not become an "island" that duplicates work already happening elsewhere.

- Tracking Issues: Owners will agree to create tracking issues in the OGC Organization that will map to the various upstreaming efforts for transparency and visibility for the group. Owners will agree to check the tracker before starting work and collaborate where necessary versus duplicating effort.
- Knowledge Sharing: Owners are agreeing to make their research public. This helps the community understand why a certain technical path was chosen based on the current state of upstream development.
- Accountability in Ownership: By documenting work, owners identify which organizations or individuals are leading specific efforts.

## Values

### Focus on the Gaming Experience
We want to provide the best in class gaming experience for projects that adopt our deliverables.

### Inclusive is better than exclusive
Broadly successful and useful technologies require different perspectives and skill sets, which can only be heard in a welcoming and respectful environment. Our community respects the time and effort put into a discussion. We honor discussion by carefully evaluating the work of our owners, members and other contributors. By doing this, it helps realize our final goal of improving the upstream ecosystem.

### Evolution is better than stagnation
Openness to new ideas and studied technological evolution make us a stronger project.

### Transparency
We endeavour to utilize the latest in open source technology to ensure our users can verify the processes used to build our deliverables. We strive to educate our users by sharing as much data as we can.

### Bias for Action
We strive to prefer stability and correctness but recognize that we must act to solve problems quickly and efficiently.

## Governance

### Decision Making

Open Gaming Collective will operate using the Lazy Consensus Model. 

Paraphrased from the [Apache Community](https://community.apache.org/committers/decisionMaking.html):

>Lazy consensus means that you don’t need to get explicit approval to proceed, but you need to be prepared to listen if someone objects.

>Lazy consensus is achieved by stating your intent on a public email, and waiting an appropriate amount of time (usually 72 hours) for anyone to object. Silence indicates consent, and after that time has passed, you can assume that nobody objects, and proceed with your plan.

>Objections to the plan should be accompanied by a legitimate reason, and be open to discussing possible alternative approaches.

This model strikes a balance of getting things done and avoiding unnecessary discussion about a change.

### Conflict Resolution

The purpose of this section is to provide some strategies for how to deal with conflict when it inevitably arises.

- Identify the Objection: Someone raises a valid concern (e.g., a -1 vote with a detailed comment) instead of staying silent.
- Focus on Ideas, Not Identity: Frame disagreements around the ideas or implementation, not the person, to avoid defensiveness (e.g., "This approach has risks" vs. "You are wrong").
- Provide Justification: Objectors must provide legitimate reasons or alternative solutions, not just say "no".

### Ownership of Decisions

Open Gaming Collective is a group made up of owners. They are **all** responsible for decisions made when they have reached consensus. It is important that owners communicate with each other and help take ownership of issues as they arise from our decisions.

### Changes to Scope

The intention of this group is to keep the scope small and focused to allow us to focus on the mission. This does not mean that the scope is not able to be changed. Changes to the scope will require a change proposal to be written and to provide reasoning for why we must change the scope. 

The change proposal must be submitted to source control as an issue for review by existing owners using Lazy Consensus.

## Communication Channels

### Source Control Platform

The source control platform will be the primary place that technical and non-technical decisions regarding the OGC will take place.

This includes but is not limited to: 
- Tracking issues for Upstream Work
- Projects or patches that will exist until work is upstreamed

### Community Chat

Community Chat can be used as a way for us to communicate or work together on problems, but cannot be used as a way to make any official decisions regarding the OGC.

## Source Control Platform Role Definitions

This document outlines the distinctions between **Owners** and **Members** within the Open Gaming Collective Organization. The primary difference lies in the balance between **Strategic Management** (Owner) and **Technical Execution** (Member).

### 1. Owner (Organization Member)

An **Owner** is a maintainer within the source control platform. Their role is focused on the "why" and "should" of the organization, ensuring that every contribution aligns with the long-term mission and organizational health. They inherit all of the requirements and responsibilities that members have.

They represent a member project, and there will be only one or two representatives from each project at the Owner level.

**Defined by:** Official membership within the Open Gaming Collective organization.

#### Requirements
* **Organizational Alignment:** Deep understanding of the project mission and how it fits into the broader Linux gaming ecosystem.
